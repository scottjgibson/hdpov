Hard Drive Persistance of Vision Clock

Based on design here:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Hard-Drive-Persistence-of-Vision-HDPOV/

Original design was a slave device controlled via serial commands; I'm starting on modifications to support a RTC (Real Time Clock) and will display the time according to the time set on that device.  Basic buttons will be added to set the time and change the color scheme)
